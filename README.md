## Simple Unity3D Targeting System Example

This is meant as an example to show how to create a simple targeting system for Unity3D, although still could be used as is on a real game.

The example will show a few cubes flying on screen, around the camera. You can then click on cubes to lock one of them, when a HUD will appear over the locked cube.

You can also cycle through different enemies (the red cubes) by pressing TAB repeatedly.
